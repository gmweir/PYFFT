--- Description ---

Swan is a tool for wavelet data analysis, and its meant to be simple in use
and easy to extend.

The current release is codenamed 'Maine-Anjou'. The further releases will be
codenamed by some cattle breed name, starting from the letter,  the current
month starts from. This major release is made in March, hence the first 'M' in the
codename. 

It has the gui program, swan, which provides you the interface to load data,
make a continuous transform with Morlet wavelet and visualise the results in
several different ways. This part depends on glade, pygtk, and matplotlib/pylab.

The wavelet transform is made with the help of the pycwt package, wich is a part of the
Swan software at the time. Pycwt is desinged to be a library for the continuous wavelet
transform via the FFT algorithm. It depends on numpy.


--- Installation ---

To install Swan, run "python setup.py install" and that should do.

"python setup.py install --help"
will provide you with additional options.

--- Dependencies ---

GTK and Glade bindings for python, matplotlib/pylab and numpy

(Under my Ubuntu GNU/Linux distribution it is achieved by:
'sudo apt-get install python-glade2 python-gtk2 matplotlib numpy'
command)

Have fun!
